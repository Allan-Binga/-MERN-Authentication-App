# MERN Authentication App

A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) app for secure user authentication and authorization.

## Overview

MERN Authentication App is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack, allowing users to securely register, login, and access authorized resources. The app ensures robust authentication and authorization features while utilizing modern technologies.

## Features

- User registration: Create a new account with email and password.
- User login: Authenticate users and generate secure access tokens.
- Access control: Restrict access to certain routes or resources based on user roles or permissions.
- Password hashing: Safely store and verify user passwords using bcrypt hashing algorithm.
- Token-based authentication: Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless and secure authentication.
- Error handling: Implement comprehensive error handling and validation for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data and credentials.
- Express.js: Fast and minimalist web application framework for building the server-side API.
- React: JavaScript library for building the user interface and handling the client-side logic.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- bcrypt: Library for hashing and verifying passwords securely.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Standard for creating access tokens used for authentication.
